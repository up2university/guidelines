# Interoperability

Interoperability is achieved by configuring the pairs of services,
so they can talk to each other:

- [LMS - FSS](lms_fss.md)
- [Jupyter - FSS](jupyter_fss.md)

For a better overview, see [the logical software architecture diagram](../architecture.md).

This part does not cover integrations of services with SSO, 
as they are covered in specific per-service parts.
