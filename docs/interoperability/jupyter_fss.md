# Interoperability between Jupyter and FSS

Interoperability between the FSS and Jupyter services
results in users having access to their FSS files also in Jupyter.
Such an integration is discussed here.

If you choose [CERNBox](../fss_cernbox.md) and [SWAN](../jupyter_swan.md),
they are integrated out of the box, and no further steps are needed.

For [Nextcloud](../fss_nextcloud.md) and [Vanilla Jupyter](../jupyter_vanilla.md),
the description comes here... TODO
