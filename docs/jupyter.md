# Jupyter - available implementations

Two alternative implementations of the Jupyter service are considered:

- [Vanilla Jupyter](jupyter_vanilla.md)
- [SWAN](jupyter_swan.md)

The choice here depends on the chosen [FSS implementation](fss.md).
Choosing Nextcloud as FSS entails choosing Vanilla Jupyter,
while choosing CERNBox as FSS entails choosing SWAN.
